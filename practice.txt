You are required to enter a word that consists of  and  that denote the number of Zs and Os respectively. The input word is considered similar to word zoo if .

Determine if the entered word is similar to word zoo.

For example, words such as zzoooo and zzzoooooo are similar to word zoo but not the words such as zzooo and zzzooooo.

Input format

First line: A word that starts with several Zs and continues by several Os.
Note: The maximum length of this word must be .
Output format

Print Yes if the input word can be considered as the string zoo otherwise, print No.

Sample Input
zzzoooooo
Sample Output
Yes


solution::
using System;
using System.Text;
 
namespace Zoo
{
	class Program
	{
		static void Main(string[] args)
		{
			string w = Console.ReadLine();
			int z=0;
			int o=0;
			foreach(char c in w)
			{
                if(c=='z'||c=='Z')
                    z++;
                else
                    o++;
			}
            if(2*z==o)
                Console.WriteLine("Yes");
            else
                Console.WriteLine("No");
		}
	}
}


2,You are provided an array  of size  that contains non-negative integers. Your task is to determine whether the number that is formed by selecting the last digit of all the N numbers is divisible by .

Note: View the sample explanation section for more clarification.

Input format

First line: A single integer  denoting the size of array 
Second line:  space-separated integers.
Output format

If the number is divisible by , then print . Otherwise, print .

Constraints

Sample Input
5
85 25 65 21 84
Sample Output
No


solution:

using System;
class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int i;
                if (int.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out i))
                {
                    string a = Console.ReadLine().Trim();
                    if (a[a.Length - 1] == '0')                   
                        Console.WriteLine("Yes");                  
                    else                  
                        Console.WriteLine("No");                  
                }    
            
        }
    }
